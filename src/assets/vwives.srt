1
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,350
I wonder what they find to

2
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,040
argue about Eric every morning.

3
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,520
The average married couple.

4
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,640
It's enough to make you stay single.

5
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,610
Why don't you think of me for a change?

6
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,900
I do, yes.

7
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,890
We've just got the goddamn car all paid off.

8
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,770
And you want to start all over again.

9
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,100
What the hell is it to us?

10
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,390
If Stanley Schriver has a new

11
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,480
Mercedes, the speed limit is 60.

12
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,190
What do you need for the Mercedes?

13
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,990
Mercedes?

14
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,810
Why, that little Schmuck deserves a mini.

15
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,090
I'm going to soup up mine to Duke 200.

16
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,300
But Julie and I won't be like that.

17
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,280
We understand each other.

18
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,100
What do you need with a lousy Volkswagen?

19
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,860
For Christ's sake, you're a

20
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,190
menace on the highway anyway.

21
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,480
All women are.

22
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,200
You'd cost me a damn fortune in insurance.

23
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,760
Let's face it, Darling, the only thing that counts

24
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,050
is for you to get what you want. Well, what about me?

25
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,010
How can I learn to drive without a car?

26
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,580
Never get the car when you go off on one of your trips.

27
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,490
Or you're watching the ball game on TV.

28
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,090
Living with you is just about as

29
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,110
romantic as living with a computer.

30
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,780
You're nothing but a goddamn computer, Mr. Computer.

31
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,950
Why you brought so logical?

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,400
For God's sake, How the hell is buying

33
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,190
a new Mercedes make me a computer.

34
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
Oh, now I'm illogical, am I?

35
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,150
Well, for what?

36
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,790
You think, a bed is nothing but

37
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,180
a place to sleep after TV. Right?

38
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
As usual, sweetie.

39
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,580
We'll talk about it later, okay? Why is it always later?

40
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,200
I love you.

41
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,660
Do you have to go so early?

42
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,220
Look, Hubert, we're both being stupid. I'm sorry.

43
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,850
Don't go yet.

44
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,780
We need a little time together. Please.

45
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,650
You always say the same damn thing.

46
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,040
You always have someplace to go, and

47
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,130
it's never to bed with me.

48
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,180
You are a computer.

49
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,320
You're all wires and circuit, not flesh and blood.

50
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,760
Who says you're a man, Hubert?

51
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,470
What I want is a man who wants to cut with a computer.

52
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,610
You program some sex into our marriage or I.

53
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,810
She's not getting any.

54
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,130
At least not from him.

55
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,640
I bet that's the problem.

56
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,090
Women get bitchy when they're not satisfied.

57
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,340
He's too busy.

58
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,450
Way too much.

59
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,600
There he goes again.

60
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,780
How can you leave her like that day after day?

61
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,400
He doesn't know what goes on when he's gone.

62
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,360
He's just asking for it.

63
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,720
And so is she.

64
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:54,360
I wonder how many times there is my story.

65
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,670
The Sexual Widow.

66
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,690
An expose.

67
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,490
My research began with the neglected

68
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,140
wife who lived across the way.

69
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,680
Hey, Hey.

70
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,110
Yoo-hoo

71
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,190
Who are you? I'm your neighbor.

72
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,770
I'm curious about you. Curious about me? Why?

73
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,620
Well, I've been observing you.

74
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,770
Oh, you mean you can see me from your apartment?

75
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,150
Well, there's more to it than that. I confess.

76
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,550
I've been watching you quarrel with your

77
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,960
husband about the way he neglects you.

78
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,480
I've also watched you walk around

79
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,070
your terrace in the Nood.

80
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,750
You think it's right to spy on a girl.

81
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,290
Well, you see, I live right over there.

82
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,450
I couldn't help looking. Oh, my God.

83
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,480
I have every right to go nude

84
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,470
or have fights here in my own house.

85
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, I sure don't mind.

86
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,320
I've enjoyed watching, but I'm only one of the crowd.

87
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,650
You don't mind being watched?

88
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,270
I'm very flattered.

89
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,670
Any girl with a body like

90
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,220
mine shouldn't keep it hidden.

91
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,650
I'm just one of Mother Nature's gifts.

92
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,690
You've got a point.

93
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,440
However one might say it's, I

94
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,440
don't care what they call it. Just a minute.

95
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,420
What's that?

96
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,970
You've got a microphone in here?

97
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,080
Are you recording?

98
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, tell me, what do you need it for?

99
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,720
What's it all about? How come? The mic.

100
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,900
Will you send here to spy on me or something?

101
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,320
No, it's nothing as sinister as that.

102
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,990
I'm a reporter.

103
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,900
I want to do a survey about women who

104
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,730
are neglected by their husband so called sexual widows.

105
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,720
I was watching you fight with your husband.

106
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,010
I'd like to tell your story.

107
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,040
Oh, I see.

108
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,860
So that's how reporters work.

109
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,440
Would you let me interview you?

110
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,020
Sure, why not?

111
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,710
I think you'd better use another name.

112
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,930
However, if you want the lurid details.

113
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,020
Sure, why not?

114
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,690
If it's really dirty, my husband is sure to read it.

115
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,760
It could be a lesson to him.

116
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,280
It's a great idea.

117
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,960
It's a deal.

118
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,700
So where do we start?

119
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,590
First, let me ask you.

120
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,080
If you consider yourself as one

121
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,670
of our sexually neglected wives. Sure.

122
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,380
I guess that includes me.

123
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,260
The last few years have been really tough for me.

124
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,010
I adjusted.

125
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,260
I've been married to Hubert for six years.

126
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,350
You might call it the seven year itch.

127
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,400
It's not, though.

128
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,930
We have one child, four and a half.

129
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,740
He's a sweet boy, really.

130
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,530
He's in kindergarten.

131
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,030
So back to my problem.

132
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,180
You know, the thing that really drives me up the wall?

133
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,250
It's his indifference.

134
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,370
He'd just as soon be gone.

135
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,890
On one of his trips, he told all

136
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,950
of our friends, Sir, I'm second choice.

137
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,520
You know the best part of the story?

138
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,470
I found all these rubbers in his briefcase.

139
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,360
You know what I mean?

140
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,410
Hundreds.

141
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,900
I use the pill so why the rubbers anyway.

142
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,690
Used rubbers too?

143
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,460
Well, that doesn't prove anything.

144
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,250
Come on.

145
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,130
It's not like finding chewing gum.

146
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,670
But you're in love with your husband.

147
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,540
Yes, if I was and I'd get out.

148
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,700
Good God.

149
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,230
How often he's left me alone.

150
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,400
And I know sometimes he must be with other women.

151
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,080
So one day I decided to do something about it.

152
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,340
First it was out of loneliness and revenge.

153
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,400
Then I found I enjoyed my secret loves.

154
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,000
Carl was the best.

155
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,960
He came into my life.

156
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,630
All of a sudden, he didn't say a word.

157
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,730
He started undressing me very slowly.

158
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,470
He was gentle.

159
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,590
And when he made love to me, it

160
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,150
was the nicest thing I had ever experienced.

161
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,020
I felt happy.

162
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,330
There was no feeling of guilt.

163
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,260
A while later, he'll think it's crazy, but it's true.

164
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,210
Something else happened.

165
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,190
A new experience.

166
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,020
I met this crazy guy.

167
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,580
It was in mid summer.

168
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,990
And he had on a dark suit,

169
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,830
a black tie and a white shirt.

170
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,150
His face was as white as his shirt.

171
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,800
And he had nutty eyes.

172
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,060
He looked like a fanatic of some sort.

173
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,180
Do you know Smith? No.

174
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,630
Smith is very hardly thought of in our circles.

175
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,090
He is the inventor of our visualorum.

176
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,710
I would now like to demonstrate for

177
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,520
you proof of Smith's claim to greatness. Sure.

178
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,070
I don't mind.

179
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,970
If you really want to keep your eyes here.

180
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,100
Try to imagine this as an act of God.

181
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,360
I doubt God would act like that.

182
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,220
Excuse me.

183
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,930
I'm burning a thorn Bush.

184
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,590
And so you are deceived by your illusions.

185
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,500
Is that my illusion?

186
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,720
Keep your eyes here.

187
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,640
You have to stay hard to pass the province of

188
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,870
the Devil's illusions or perish in the Valley of Tears.

189
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,390
You must not think of what is in the picture.

190
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,880
Only what is in your mind.

191
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,890
What is all this for, though?

192
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,330
Oh, how can you dare to ask me that?

193
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,310
Your mind is not on the demonstration.

194
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,920
You're not involving yourself.

195
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,740
What if everyone behaved this way?

196
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,530
We're back in the Stone Age, living

197
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,560
in caves, thinking of only lower things.

198
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,640
We must raise ourselves up. Our minds. Everything up.

199
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,740
Don't you see?

200
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,250
No kidding.

201
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,660
You've missed your calling.

202
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,990
You could be writing super commercials.

203
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,560
You know, our soap is God's soap and all that.

204
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,750
You're really good. I see.

205
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,390
I must take a different approach.

206
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm getting nowhere with intellectual methodology.

207
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,150
I shall try the material down to Earth approach.

208
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,450
Our rapport is too casual.

209
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,660
We must come down to the melting

210
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,860
of the mind and the body.

211
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,180
I was wrong before.

212
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,200
Now we must begin with the body.

213
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,580
Is that goofy or not?

214
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,840
He had a motorcycle.

215
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,980
Too crazy.

216
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,540
And your husband's not aware of what's going on?

217
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,510
How would he know?

218
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,560
He's never here during the day like you are.

219
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,910
After the success of that first interview,

220
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,120
I was eager to continue my research.

221
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,210
I knew I had uncovered a story with universal appeal.

222
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,390
But I had no idea how universal

223
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,460
the problem of sexual neglect had become.

224
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,860
I was soon to find out.

225
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,340
Let's call her Anita.

226
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,340
She was married to a very wealthy man.

227
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,770
He provided her with every luxury but

228
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,670
neglected the one basic necessity she craved.

229
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,430
I don't think there's anything else to say.

230
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,680
We did go over things sorrow, didn't we?

231
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,290
I'm amused by your ad.

232
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,060
If you promise not to use my name.

233
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,230
And I'm sure you're too much of a gentleman for that.

234
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,740
I'll let you use the story.

235
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,510
I'm glad that you find it useful.

236
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,790
You're very nice.

237
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,330
And I'll be using the story. All right.

238
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,320
But you are helping me in another way too.

239
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm doing this to pay for my law studies.

240
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,880
You study law with what

241
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,480
you've earned from our scandals?

242
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,410
Well, to me it's a fair exchange.

243
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,980
We are both arranging life to our needs.

244
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,770
You know, my husband maintains it's the only sister.

245
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,000
Each one does as he pleases.

246
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,600
He's in Acapulco.

247
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,760
So I think Karen, you know where Daddy is now?

248
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,290
How should I know?

249
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,210
Last time we saw Daddy was around Christmas.

250
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,710
I think she thinks he's an airline pilot.

251
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,040
We never see him.

252
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,840
Once in a while we get a card.

253
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,130
Or he asked me to send

254
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,950
money like you would a Secretary.

255
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,430
Or he'll ask me to go see his oldest son.

256
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,390
Poor kid is kept in a boarding school.

257
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,090
And, you know, Michael doesn't even try to see him.

258
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,940
Could I ask you how old you are?

259
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,440
What would you guess?

260
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,450
Well, that's not a fair question from a woman.

261
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,880
A Tiger stood and looked in my soul.

262
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,220
Further and further, he led me Himalaya.

263
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,210
Himalaya.

264
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,870
Ovale of Maya.

265
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,200
Amaya. What's?

266
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,130
Amaya.

267
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,970
You ever hear of Amaya?

268
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,250
Maya? Yeah.

269
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,260
It's a Buddhist word.

270
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,670
It means illusion.

271
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,340
Like life.

272
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,590
Like a false view.

273
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,600
We should open our eyes and see

274
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,620
That's Maya, it's nice of you to explain it.

275
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,600
I love you for it. Do you? Thanks.

276
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,180
Such a bright little girl.

277
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,770
It's hard to believe the story her mother just told me.

278
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,270
The way she amuses herself.

279
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,660
When Karen's at school.

280
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,630
You look bored.

281
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,040
No wonder why not go off on a trip for a week.

282
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,500
Your husband's still away.

283
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,670
You need some change of scenery, Ms. Karen.

284
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll wait for her vacation.

285
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,320
I'm going off next week.

286
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,840
I've got an idea.

287
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,590
Why don't you forget everything and come

288
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,770
with me to the Costa del Seoul?

289
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,120
I have lots of good friends there.

290
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,900
And they'll be wild about you, too.

291
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,120
Sometimes I ask myself, what's the reason for all this?

292
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,110
I didn't marry Michael only because he's rich.

293
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,990
It was really love at first sight.

294
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,610
Yet in the way, it's disappointing.

295
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,870
It's not all I want.

296
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,060
Sometimes I feel I should Chuck it all.

297
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,810
Then I think about Karen.

298
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,750
And I realize it's really for her, not me, that I stay.

299
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,680
Don't kid yourself.

300
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,690
You're not being Noble.

301
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,910
You like living in stars.

302
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,390
Don't go psychoanalyzing.

303
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,270
We know about Freud and all that.

304
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,510
If I were poor, I'd acted another way, I guess.

305
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,490
Anyway, I assure you that I'm completely normal.

306
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,680
Let's forget about women's problems.

307
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,970
Quite honestly, my only problem is greed.

308
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,450
When you think your husband is

309
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,540
actually so much older than you.

310
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,860
And he still has to work hard for you.

311
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,670
It doesn't seem fair to talk about having affairs.

312
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,010
We really both behave the same way.

313
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,470
But the only difference is you

314
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,280
have no children to worry about.

315
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,100
Come over here, young man.

316
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,840
Over here.

317
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,400
I want some flowers in here.

318
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,690
It looks so naked without them.

319
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,440
I want a big, round flower bed.

320
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,080
And here another flower bed with a huge

321
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,880
phallic symbol jutting up in the center.

322
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,920
Surrounded by pansies about so high

323
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,440
and round on the top. Okay.

324
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,190
Why are you shy?

325
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,510
Why be so modest.

326
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,850
Don't be shy. She's a friend.

327
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,910
Come, let's see all those muscles.

328
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,390
So it's your muscle.

329
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,530
What do you think, Olga?

330
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,280
What do we need with the Costa del Sol?

331
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,510
What's wrong with here?

332
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,580
Come, join me.

333
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,460
There's plenty for both of us.

334
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,750
Yeah, it's hard to believe.

335
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,110
I'm glad I'm just a reporter, not a judge. Come on.

336
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,750
Your drink is getting warm.

337
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,150
You mix a strong drink.

338
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,360
Lady, you really know how to treat a guy. Candy's dandy.

339
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,160
But liquor's quicker, as they say.

340
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,040
I ask you how old you are.

341
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,640
Don't you want to answer?

342
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,060
How do I know you won't hold it against me?

343
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,190
All right.

344
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,130
I'm 30.

345
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,280
And I've managed to find a husband who's

346
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,450
a millionaire, who goes to bed with me

347
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,180
once every two or three months.

348
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,410
He's always away on business.

349
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,560
Just a wait period.

350
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,740
It's all the same.

351
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,790
I wasn't born to be a nun.

352
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,690
Believe me, that doesn't happen to be my bag.

353
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,380
I don't like to be neurotic.

354
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,060
And I hate hysterical women.

355
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,520
So my solution is to find men.

356
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,910
All that interests me is the

357
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,720
quality of their love making.

358
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,040
I don't really ask so much out of life.

359
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,920
I love my husband, too.

360
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,290
I also try the standard full technique stopping

361
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,140
women in the street to get their reactions

362
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,010
to the problem of marital sexual neglect.

363
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,090
I'll answer your question.

364
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,100
I'm doing a survey on sexual activity in the home.

365
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,640
Excuse me.

366
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,620
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband.

367
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,930
I wish I had one.

368
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,080
Excuse me.

369
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,250
Are you married?

370
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,860
What business is it of yours?

371
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,070
Oh, I'm a reporter.

372
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,650
That's a new approach.

373
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,650
Excuse me.

374
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,730
I'm taking a survey. Are you married?

375
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,630
Would you answer a question? Well, it depends. On what?

376
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,750
It's a personal one.

377
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,600
Does your husband satisfy you?

378
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,710
I wish you well. How about you? No, she's not married.

379
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,480
Are you?

380
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,550
You and your husband talk much about sex? Naturally.

381
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,520
Does it help?

382
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,060
We usually get it on. Okay.

383
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,330
Will you excuse me, please?

384
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,790
I'm doing a survey on married life.

385
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,110
Does your husband neglect you?

386
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,480
Sometimes, yes.

387
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,680
Do you feel he gives you as

388
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,860
much sexual attention as you'd like? No, sir.

389
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,390
Well, thank you and good luck.

390
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,380
Most of the interviews on

391
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,110
the street didn't reveal much.

392
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,100
In public places, people wear a

393
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,010
mask to hide their inner feelings.

394
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,910
Only their eyes reveal the search for understanding

395
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,370
and compassion that drives them from their lonely

396
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,050
homes to the anonymity of a crowded street.

397
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,910
They need warmth and companionship, but too

398
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,830
often they are afraid to accept it.

399
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,090
So they return to their individual prisons and wait

400
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,740
for the love and attention they so desperately need.

401
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,940
Millions of lonely women live in our midst,

402
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,150
neglected by their husbands, ready and willing to

403
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,560
offer their tenderness if they have the chance.

404
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,130
In my search for the secret hidden behind each

405
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,760
face in the crowd, I happened upon an unusual

406
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,790
story I haven't been able to forget.

407
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,860
Well, here we are knitting again.

408
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,850
Blackie.

409
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,790
It would have been different if I had a baby.

410
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,960
I wouldn't mind knitting for a baby of my own.

411
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,210
Don't have to be jealous, Darling.

412
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,720
There's nothing we can do this year.

413
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,590
First we have to pay off the television set.

414
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,210
But next year we can think about a baby.

415
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,550
I tried to tell Carl I'd find some work

416
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,720
who could use my money for the baby.

417
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,440
But he didn't want that.

418
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,600
No, he doesn't want me to work.

419
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,980
He just wants me to stay

420
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,140
home and look beautiful for him.

421
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,650
I told him the sooner or later I get bored.

422
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,190
But I can't always watch television.

423
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,900
The housework is finished in no time at all.

424
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,190
So it's compensation.

425
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,180
Come on and be still.

426
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,520
You know we're not allowed to have a dog.

427
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,130
Get in here. There's no barking.

428
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,300
You hear the landlord throw us both out.

429
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,250
Don't be afraid.

430
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,840
Mommy will be right back.

431
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,670
Good morning, Mrs Brennan.

432
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,250
May I come in, please?

433
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,560
Do I have something to talk to you about?

434
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,930
Would you like a beer?

435
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,350
Could I have some of that?

436
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,880
Go ahead, help yourself.

437
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,360
Very hot today.

438
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,740
Too hot.

439
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,580
Do you have a glass over there?

440
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,910
I like sun.

441
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,900
I've been sunbathing all day.

442
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,360
We've had enough rain this year.

443
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,850
I'd like to get together with you.

444
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,080
To do what?

445
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,600
Can't it wait till my husband gets home?

446
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,830
What do you want? Leave me alone. Have you gone mad?

447
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,960
Go away. I've been asking for it.

448
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,080
You don't lie about me and naked

449
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,200
just to get a stunt head.

450
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,770
You leave me alone, you hear?

451
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,970
You must be crazy.

452
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,780
Where did my husband come home?

453
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,030
I know about you and your dog.

454
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,120
Don't think I don't.

455
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,400
I'll let you keep the dog.

456
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,150
I'll do your favor and you do me a favor.

457
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
We make a deal.

458
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,020
I don't tell the landlady about your dog and

459
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,520
you cooperate that we do a little something.

460
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,140
You know what I mean?

461
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,160
Bastard. Wait. Come back.

462
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,130
It was all over when I got there.

463
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,250
But it wasn't difficult to

464
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,420
figure out what had happened.

465
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,120
The police record read accidental death.

466
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,160
And does it really matter who is to blame?

467
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,410
The husband, the janitor herself.

468
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,460
It can make any difference to her now.

469
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,080
Are you from the press? Yes. I'm a reporter.

470
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,090
Poor girl.

471
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,960
She was so young. A nice girl.

472
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,280
But always left alone like that.

473
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,210
What a pity.

474
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,060
The one thing that these women I've talked to have

475
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,260
in common is the lack of love in their lives.

476
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,870
There are many kinds of love.

477
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,210
From platonic friendship to passion and brutality.

478
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,450
How much have sex and neuroticism

479
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,900
really to do with love?

480
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,010
People use them for making love.

481
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,960
But they only limit love.

482
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,910
Nobody has ever defined it clearly.

483
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,810
There's no way you can't define any emotion.

484
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,630
You can't make love fit preconceived forms.

485
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,510
Love defies analysis.

486
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,560
Love just is.

487
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,600
Can you tell me, Julia, what our love is?

488
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,340
Define it.

489
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,440
Drop the philosophy our philosophy is

490
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,060
supposed to be all cerebral.

491
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,590
Cerebrals are impotent.

492
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,800
Listen to this.

493
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,210
I don't care what you write about me, even my name.

494
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,400
We all live together on this planet, and

495
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,750
we're all parts of the universal consciousness.

496
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,190
Love is the ultimate goal.

497
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,800
But since we're imperfect creatures, we

498
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,990
have to settle for sex.

499
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,220
And personally, I don't mind at all.

500
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,160
My husband is like a rabbit in bed. Wham, bam,

501
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,290
Thank you, ma'am.

502
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,460
So I have plenty of energy left.

503
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,910
For the men in my life.

504
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,990
I'm never selfish with a life force.

505
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,950
I'll have three or four orgasms in an hour.

506
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,180
If a man's up to it, and

507
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,920
with the right encouragement, he usually is.

508
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,960
Hey, that seems odd, but she'd tell you all that?

509
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,890
She didn't hide a thing.

510
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,410
What's so strange about it?

511
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,660
You'd think that every woman in

512
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,570
town wanted to bear her soul.

513
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,130
Most of them fight for the chance.

514
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,650
They get their kicks out of it.

515
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,530
But you must get some kind of kick yourself.

516
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,650
What interests me is getting the interview.

517
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,750
Oh, come on. You can't quit now.

518
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,980
We're just getting started.

519
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,720
Is that more of your report?

520
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,420
Yeah, hours of it.

521
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,210
How do I make this thing work?

522
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,690
Turn the knob to the right and push the start button.

523
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,110
I'm a sort of a wire by ear.

524
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,900
Why don't you give me one of those?

525
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,650
And the best part of the story?

526
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,510
I found these rubbers in his briefcase.

527
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,600
You know what I mean?

528
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,780
Condoms and I use the pills.

529
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,940
Oh, no, not turn it off yet, please.

530
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,480
I'm interested in her story.

531
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,300
I'll let you hear something better.

532
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,130
You.

533
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,890
You pretend you're such an angel.

534
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,550
What if you were only taking sexual

535
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,370
advantage of all these poor women?

536
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,490
What if your purpose was really only to

537
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,910
talk these women into cheap love affairs?

538
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,150
So what if it were?

539
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,740
I started to worry about myself.

540
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,960
I don't know why I had the hots for him at first.

541
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,140
After my husband died, I didn't

542
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,570
want anything to do with men.

543
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,530
My husband, he was real rough in bed.

544
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,780
And it was a relief not to have to put out.

545
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,960
But I'm only human.

546
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,730
I guess I'm not that old with him around all the time.

547
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,760
Well, I'm only human.

548
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,350
Like I said, my son in law is a real bomb.

549
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,440
My daughter only knew him two weeks.

550
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,090
Love at first sight.

551
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,700
He has long hair and a long cock.

552
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,080
That's the only thing he's got going for.

553
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,940
Doesn't he have a job?

554
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,280
You kidding. Work?

555
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,510
That's a four letter word.

556
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,910
My daughter works.

557
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,150
Carl is a switch board operator.

558
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,590
They live in my house on her money.

559
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,040
They even took a honeymoon on her money.

560
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,810
That's where the trouble started.

561
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,500
On their wedding night.

562
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,440
She wouldn't do what he wanted.

563
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,310
She was a Virgin, for God's sake.

564
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:08,560
You don't ask a Virgin to do what he wanted.

565
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,340
With me, it's different.

566
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,430
I'm older, but I don't even

567
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,870
like some of his weird ideas.

568
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,430
He's a pervert.

569
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,130
It wouldn't have happened if Carla had stayed home.

570
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,230
But she left.

571
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,870
She just didn't come home one day.

572
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,630
And there I was with him and his long cock.

573
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,620
After all, I'm only human.

574
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,230
Clean out your own part, you filthy Pig.

575
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,280
Well, it sure is hot in here today.

576
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,110
Why don't we have any air conditioning?

577
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,140
Go out and earn it.

578
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,870
You want to live in luxury?

579
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,320
Go make some money.

580
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,020
You better learn that.

581
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,420
Stop it.

582
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,010
You think I don't know you get past me, huh?

583
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,220
Let's do it.

584
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,570
Well, what's up mother?

585
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,470
You're back at last.

586
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,310
Where have you been for the last 16 days, huh?

587
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,130
Well, I'd be out of your way. Yeah.

588
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,650
You should have stayed there.

589
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,140
You should have stayed there.

590
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,780
Oh, shut your mouth, will you?

591
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,680
I knew you weren't at the office.

592
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,850
I sure wasn't.

593
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,440
Damn right.

594
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,760
The hell with that.

595
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,210
I'm not that crazy.

596
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,330
I should go bring back all my pay so that

597
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,750
my mother can go whoring around with my husband.

598
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,710
And two can do that.

599
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,490
You know, I slept with ten men

600
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,180
a night for the last five days.

601
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,200
I made a fortune and I'm not feeling a bit sorry.

602
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,540
And you won't see a Penny of it.

603
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,870
Now, if you want, you can have what

604
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,920
you asked for on our first night.

605
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,390
That's it.

606
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,280
And now we're just one big unhappy family like before.

607
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,240
That is really unbelievable.

608
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,880
Darling, you do meet the nicest people in your work.

609
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,360
What's the matter?

610
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,710
There's a naked girl in that terrace. Where is she?

611
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,170
One of your sexual widows.

612
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,040
Show me.

613
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,640
It's the next building over.

614
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,350
It's a site you're used to, I suppose.

615
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,940
No, I'm just as surprised as you are.

616
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,570
You ought to look for another place to live.

617
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:05,980
My dear Oliver, what have you written so far?

618
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,290
Sexual widows and Expose.

619
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,810
The second breakfast is called Love by Oliver Despair.

620
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,150
I have followed my love for ages.

621
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,900
Say, what have you done here?

622
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,900
She looked so sweet and young.

623
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,190
She was blonde with long and silky hair.

624
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,450
The kind you find in old romantic novels.

625
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,030
She wore it with such easy Grace.

626
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,820
But she was only 16 years old.

627
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,470
Her breasts were tiny, but of such

628
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,390
a perfection they hurt the eye.

629
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,050
I know why your eyes are bad.

630
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,010
It's from looking two hearted girls.

631
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,160
We sat under the chestnut tree

632
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,050
in the Kaiser's Alley and Bonne.

633
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,270
She drank a what? A Coke.

634
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,370
I had a beer.

635
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,490
Why didn't you have a brandy, Oliver?

636
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,550
It was one of those fantastic days.

637
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,580
A summer idol.

638
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,690
And her Shapy legs were tanned

639
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,370
like columns of solid gold.

640
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,700
The legs of a goddess of Egypt or of ancient Greece.

641
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,560
Too beautiful for words.

642
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,390
Oh, man, you really are a poet.

643
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,440
It doesn't read like reported stuff.

644
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh, that's what the public wants.

645
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,980
Hello.

646
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,490
Yeah, what?

647
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,700
In half an hour.

648
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,730
Oh, kids, you must be putting me on.

649
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,950
I'm still in pajamas.

650
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,490
Okay, see you. Let's go.

651
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,610
Hurry wear my clothes.

652
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,790
Why do you always hide my clothes?

653
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,020
You can come with me.

654
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,000
What for?

655
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,770
Because I don't want you to become a sexual widow.

656
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,850
We're going to break that widow legend.

657
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,280
The wife should work at her husband's side.

658
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,920
She should share the hard work and pain so she

659
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,750
will realize how much he puts up with for it.

660
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,180
You know the 30 Years War.

661
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,380
Women fought side by side with their man.

662
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:49,220
So hurry to the war.

663
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,050
My zippers shot.

664
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,600
Right on, baby. That's great.

665
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,400
Marilyn Monroe all over again. Great.

666
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,120
So up on the boards.

667
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,400
Get us some height up there. Not bad.

668
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,440
You're the greatest. Got it. Good.

669
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,240
You ought to be a model.

670
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,710
Now sit on that table.

671
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,920
We'll get some leg shots. Come on.

672
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,620
Great.

673
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,690
Now a little to the left. Yeah, like that.

674
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,370
Now smile at the birdie.

675
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,630
Good move down here for the sex kitten stuff.

676
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,440
Right here.

677
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,810
We want to see those little apples in your chair.

678
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,100
Turn this way a little.

679
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,760
We want to show off your talents.

680
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,150
We'll do more of this in the studio.

681
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,910
We can work at the serious stuff there.

682
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,950
Yeah, we'll really come up with something.

683
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,110
We're going to make you the most

684
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,830
talked about doll and show business.

685
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,410
You're going to hit the cover of every rag in town.

686
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,290
You and me are on our way up.

687
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,930
We're going places, Darl, you're going to

688
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,170
knock them dead in New York.

689
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,910
I'm going to do you upright. Hi. Hello, friend.

690
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,670
What's new?

691
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,850
Hello, Julia.

692
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,550
How come you're keeping Julia from work?

693
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,610
She's helping me with my sexual widow's

694
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,630
piece about the pitfalls of lonely wives.

695
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,440
It's not only the lonely ones who have

696
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,490
a pitfall or two to tell about. That's right.

697
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,550
You should ask Eva here.

698
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,750
She can tell you a few things that'll kill your ears.

699
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,660
Ask yourself.

700
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,710
Oh, baby, I can.

701
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,120
But the story is going to cost you money.

702
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,800
I don't give my goodies out except

703
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:33,030
for money, it'll mean a lot of publicity. Come on.

704
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,010
All I need is money.

705
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,620
Give me the bread and you can have a publicity.

706
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,620
Oh, come on, nature girl. Give us a sample.

707
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,160
Blow his mind a little.

708
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:41,560
Okay.

709
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,400
I was married young.

710
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,970
Henry is my husband.

711
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,900
And Henry, you know what he does?

712
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,860
He's a Butcher, a doll of a guy.

713
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,650
We give good service.

714
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,640
Our motto is, Please the Customer.

715
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:59,440
Well, you see, I have a business of my own.

716
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:04,420
I believe my customers, my Sugar Puffs, are great.

717
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,210
They love my all day suckers

718
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,840
They're my specialty.

719
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,150
The shop's a candy store.

720
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,890
You see, the best costume I've got is ought to Libre.

721
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,460
An old fashioned kind of man.

722
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,160
So Richie reeks of it.

723
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,030
He's wild, though.

724
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,270
He plays so rough.

725
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,510
He likes to play a little

726
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,550
game which we call Mouse tail.

727
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,860
The first one to pin down
my mouse, wins my tail

728
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,230
Nobody but you will ever

729
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,820
be my little mouse to you.

730
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,170
I always say a prayer for him

731
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,100
at night, give us a different pose.

732
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,180
We found all those.

733
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,910
They're so good to me.

734
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,170
I wouldn't want him to be hurt. Ever.

735
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,850
Sometimes the mouth
can just get so boring.

736
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,270
But then we do it some other way.

737
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,790
We try to do things with imagination.

738
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,840
We're building a cottage.

739
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,390
It'll be finished by next month.

740
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,700
He promised it's just for the two of us.

741
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,370
On my birthday, he bought me a new sports car.

742
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,560
Wasn't that nice?

743
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,400
On Christmas, we're flying to Rio together.

744
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,480
It seems a shame to have to shot my shop, though.

745
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,530
Since I started, my personalized customer

746
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,020
service profits have increased 400%.

747
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:47,020
You know, my sweet, I've built many houses in my day.

748
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,370
Watching stone and cement no longer gives me joy.

749
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,820
They are lifeless forms now.

750
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,260
With my life almost over, I want

751
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,160
to enjoy the other forms for change.

752
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,680
My husband, Henry, doesn't quite make it

753
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,820
in high society, being a bloody Butcher.

754
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,750
His work is so brutal, so inelegant.

755
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,190
But they're alike in a way.

756
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,590
I mean, they're both pervert.

757
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,630
Sort of looking at Otto makes

758
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,230
me think of Henry somehow.

759
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,200
Well, I got a split.

760
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,900
We got a couple more victims to see. See you.

761
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,710
You look like you're tired. Not easy, is it?

762
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,090
Trying to keep face with your husband.

763
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,430
See what we go through with my husband.

764
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,230
We're not married yet.

765
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:17,530
We will be soon if you still want to.

766
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,310
After all you've heard, I think I'd better

767
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,250
go to work and let you handle that. What you go through.

768
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,330
If your story is too much

769
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,310
for me, would you repeat that?

770
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,080
For the record, you're going to use it against me? Yeah.

771
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,810
I dropped Julia off at work, promising to pick

772
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,220
her up later and headed out of the city.

773
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,650
I had an appointment to keep in Dorenberg

774
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,210
with a woman who chose to remain anonymous.

775
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,920
You'll soon discover why

776
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:16,500
Dorenburg a friendly and
quiet, clean, innocent little town.

777
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,050
A washing machine in every home.

778
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,010
Hygienic souls dry cleaned every Sunday in Church.

779
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,860
Moral hygiene lets one sleep with

780
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,960
an easy conscience in anyone's bed.

781
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:28,790
Dornburg the last place you'd look for sexual deviates.

782
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,090
If all the mothers of all those

783
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,040
kids knew who their fathers were.

784
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,410
120 inhabitants.

785
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,750
70 are adults.

786
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:25,400
2500 are married couples. On paper.

787
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,830
In short, just one big family.

788
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,260
One big family in more ways than one

789
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,130
You may say I was at fault.

790
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,870
Sure, call me guilty if you want, but

791
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,390
I'm not the one who started it.

792
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,720
But anyway, no one cares. It was first.

793
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,220
Hey, what gives with those two?

794
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,790
A couple of sleepy heads.

795
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,050
I'll bet they're both completely

796
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,150
stoned from all the wide.

797
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,000
In you go.

798
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,530
Handbag that woman. Pirates.

799
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,830
You can't do this.

800
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,730
She can't swim when she's sleeping. It isn't fair.

801
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,220
Get that chick here.

802
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:02,610
Look at him.

803
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,930
The hero's end youth today has no use for the week in.

804
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,340
Weywood let him sleep. He's happy.

805
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,810
Where did Lisa go?

806
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,110
I don't see her anywhere.

807
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:32,350
I guess she must be in the boat

808
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:42,110
you better go and have a look

809
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,110
yes, you're right I better check to

810
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,630
be sure that she's ok

811
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:46,060
From a yacht I found out he
was intrigued not a problem

812
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,850
he said and so that was the start of the

813
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,110
convenient arrangement between
us that changed our entire life. We had

814
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:58,190
fun together we were inseparable a
real close relationship. A honeymoon

815
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:02,920
for four there's nothing we
didn't do together. One big happy

816
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:09,380
family we got used to it
Lisa told me she wasn't

817
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,780
taking the pill any longer she
said she couldn't be sure of anything

818
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,970
We used to joke about the idea that if

819
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,350
Lisa had a child the
chances were it would look like

820
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:29,010
my husband we were happy
though I think we simply didn't

821
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:34,750
question the relationship we
kept common sense out of it.

822
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:51,790
hey, have you two ever tried this? No.

823
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:54,530
Come on, try it it's great Soapy

824
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,010
orgasm choose your own brand of soap

825
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:12,940
Jasmine, Lavender, Fantastic
So slippery, Eric, you do it.

826
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:14,120
That's better.

827
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:22,460
That's great, oooh yeah

828
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:08,900
After that Lisa and I went off
alone together as often as possible

829
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:20,700
had you ever loved a woman before sexually?

830
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:23,080
I never touched a woman before.

831
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:27,510
I never even considered it, I
thought only women who couldn't get

832
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,590
a man made love to each other.

833
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,120
I know better now. Why do
women have sex together?

834
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:39,410
Women understand each other's
needs, they're gentler, more loving

835
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:44,770
more in tune. Was sex
with Lisa as satisfying

836
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,850
as it was with your husband or Peter?

837
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,210
It was so much better. Men are selfish about sex and

838
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,770
they make women become selfish too. With Lisa we both gave

839
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,140
ourselves up completely and it was beautiful.

840
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:43,670
It didnt last. Happiness can never last. Other emotions intrude
and destroy a jealousy, suspicion

841
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,590
but for a time I lived just to make love with her.

842
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,440
It was so romantic.

843
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,820
What is Screwy hang up.

844
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:21,730
It... was like a marriage Lisa and me our husband's also made

845
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:27,490
it in bed. I'm sure it wouldn't have happened if they

846
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,910
weren't hung up on sex on group sex and especially on

847
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,930
wife swapping. I can't seem to be happy no matter what

848
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,010
I do now.

849
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,270
How'd it go today?

850
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,430
Get anything good?

851
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,840
My research is over I have more than enough for

852
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:50,390
the series oh, Darling, that's great here's one for you.

853
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,030
What is it?

854
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,370
What gave you the idea to start a sex school?

855
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:57,920
Disillusionment and money and there's a real need for it

856
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,020
I have to turn them away Is that true?

857
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,390
Oh, yes, it's true all right.

858
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,690
Big success listen, I wouldn't say it was my real

859
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,190
vocation I wanted to be a nun One of those

860
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,040
orders where you don't talk but the

861
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,750
sex school seemed like a better idea.

862
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,600
Good morning girls... please

863
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,760
In our last class you were called you were reminded that you

864
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:39,680
must ignore all that you have been taught before you're

865
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,950
to concentrate now on your beautiful bodies.

866
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,060
Both yours and your partners. You ready?

867
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,040
We shall continue then.

868
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:49,830
All right.

869
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,770
What was it we call the Sex zone?

870
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,810
The erogenous zone. That's it.

871
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,930
Let's examine the first.

872
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,050
The face is, in fact, a zone of erogenous intensity.

873
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,800
It sends out signals from the eyes, the

874
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:02,700
nose and the ears straight to the brain.

875
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,790
Then from there, the erotic signals are

876
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,180
transmitted to the other erogenous zones of

877
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,000
the body like a switchboard.

878
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,470
It doesn't seem right.

879
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:11,710
What doesn't seem right?

880
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,790
My little chick.

881
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,880
Well, Where's the kicks?

882
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,670
With no man, my little chickadee.

883
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,460
Sometimes a man may not be the answer.

884
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,580
We must rely on fantasies for help.

885
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,240
I don't really think fantasies is

886
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,270
good as a man, though.

887
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,290
Honest, I do.

888
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,310
And I can prove it. That's why we're here.

889
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,320
We're being taught a nuns way to sex.

890
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:33,180
Would you say your husband really satisfies you?

891
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,750
I don't complain, really.

892
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,720
He satisfies you mentally or physically?

893
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,250
Well, mentally, I've got to admit, I

894
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:44,380
suppose his body work is weak.

895
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,270
But without the proper body work, you know,

896
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,390
where does he give you a charge?

897
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,060
Or do you feel he could do better?

898
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,250
Oh, yeah, he could do a lot better.

899
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,670
I know that Richard works for a big

900
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,470
company and has a lot of responsibilities.

901
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,790
He comes home late and he's always tired.

902
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:04,130
I lie there awake at night, not knowing what to do.

903
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,130
That's how it is.

904
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,240
And when you want love, you must sneak

905
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,810
up and take it like a snake.

906
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:12,410
Oh, I don't want to feel like a snake.

907
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,750
I just wish he'd bring me some red roses once

908
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,850
in a while to show he loves me and call

909
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,080
me during the day and take me out at night.

910
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,300
And that's not asking a lot. That's it.

911
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:25,730
Of course, you don't ask anything

912
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,580
but your emancipation from neglect.

913
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,960
You must go after a solution of a different kind.

914
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,510
Or you'll never be free.

915
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:34,680
And now let us go on with the demonstration, shall we?

916
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:37,180
The next zone we have to know is right there.

917
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:38,940
Watch my fingers.

918
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:41,080
See how it causes her to react.

919
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,540
It's very sensitive.

920
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,810
Then the bust, the nipples.

921
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,260
A very sensitive area.

922
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,130
But there's no part that can be

923
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,130
compared to the Mound of Venus.

924
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:58,830
All of this area is the hot zone.

925
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,250
Also here, under the buttocks, the inner upper

926
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:09,690
thighs and the center of our desires.

927
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,430
As your girls have seen, there are numerous areas

928
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,460
to be explored without the help of men.

929
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,560
No, that simply isn't true.

930
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,390
Theory is all right, but you can't

931
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:25,980
do it right without a man.

932
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,850
Without one, you haven't any real fulfillment.

933
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:33,240
Whatever you do, men are needed here's. Your man.

934
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,540
That's not the real thing.

935
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:40,870
Oh, sometimes it's better than the real thing.

936
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:41,980
And you can't be hurt.

937
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,150
You'll never suffer disillusionment.

938
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,270
Let's look at it realistically.

939
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,090
Men are too rough, too brutal.

940
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:51,540
They're the same.

941
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,460
Let's make love, not war.

942
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:55,010
And women are made for love.

943
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,170
Men are made for war.

944
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,330
So let the men will fight the

945
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,760
wars and the girls make love. You agree?

946
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,330
And when they are not fighting,

947
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,980
they're always away at work.

948
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,170
They say they do it for you.

949
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:06,950
But no, girls, that's their bag.

950
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,930
Not to work for us, but for their own power drives.

951
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,170
For men have to compete

952
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,760
or they are unfulfilled themselves.

953
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:17,570
Their cars, possessions, football, all sports

954
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,830
are the enemy of women.

955
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,440
Yes, yes.

956
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:23,940
Enemies of the things that are the real

957
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,380
meaning of a woman's reason for being.

958
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:30,010
Therefore, we must learn to live without men.

959
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,320
The day is at hand.

960
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:33,230
We must look to our own nature.

961
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,970
We must save our soul.

962
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,570
A man can give just so much.

963
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,050
And we need so much more to feel

964
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:39,680
the way a woman wants to feel.

965
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:40,920
For we are life and we

966
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:42,520
are the essence that life requires.

967
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,340
No man will ever permit himself to understand that.

968
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:50,100
Yes, they and their poor knows their degradation

969
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:53,010
of woman kind are your enemies, girls.

970
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,770
Men have their Airlines, their

971
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,310
offices, their board meetings.

972
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:57,730
They're not our chores.

973
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:59,020
Ours is love.

974
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,960
So let us look to love

975
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:03,280
and love alone for our satisfaction.

976
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,390
Let's make love our life.

977
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,490
Men will turn to us when they know their mistake.

978
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:08,890
But it will be too late.

979
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:11,450
We shall have freed ourselves from their domination.

980
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:01,970
No, ma'am, you can't. Go ahead, knock.

981
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,800
But, Darling, you can't come in here.

982
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:06,070
Then come into another room.

983
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,050
Richard, these gentlemen will excuse it.

984
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,260
Darling, we're having a meeting, as you can see.

985
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:10,980
Meeting.

986
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,820
And I say, to hell with your lousy meeting.

987
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,710
You're going to make love.

988
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,840
My Darling, please.

989
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,270
You don't know what you're saying.

990
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,410
I know what you and I are going to do.

991
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,470
Darling, shall we use a bed or even a couch?

992
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,560
But, sweetheart, please.

993
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:25,670
Oh, please, you.

994
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,390
That's exactly what I want to do.

995
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,730
And that's what I want from you.

996
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,960
Come on to bed.

997
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,820
But, dearest, I'm not able to just leave.

998
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,650
Oh, let your boy hear what you can do then.

999
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:37,390
Do you love me or do you not love me?

1000
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,770
We have an important meeting.

1001
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:40,050
We have an agenda.

1002
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,900
And we've got an agenda, too.

1003
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,340
You and I have married business.

1004
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,730
Darling, I mean it.

1005
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,720
I am fed up to here with our nonmarriage.

1006
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,140
Darling, we'll finish our meeting if

1007
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,770
you'll wait outside until I'm finished.

1008
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,860
I'll see you then, and we can talk about it.

1009
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,160
Go have yourself an ice cream.

1010
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,650
I am not a child and I

1011
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,210
will not become a neglected wife.

1012
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:58,460
Either we make up right now or

1013
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,630
I go somewhere else for it. You decide.

1014
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:03,000
We settle our little problem right now. Or else.

1015
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,390
You mean right here?

1016
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:05,490
Right here.

1017
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,510
Do you want it now or never?

1018
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:12,520
But, Darling, which is it? Yes.

1019
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:29,380
Good for her.

1020
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,750
She had the right idea.

1021
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,470
Don't let your man neglect you.

1022
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,990
But we don't have that problem.

1023
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,900
Not yet, not ever.

1024
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:14,730
Take thee, Oliver for my lawful wedded husband?

1025
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:30,610
Will we make it through the bad times?

1026
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:33,840
Don't I think so.

1027
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:35,790
I know the dangers now.

1028
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:38,760
And I've learned how to keep you happy.

1029
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:41,460
We'll make it.

1030
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,760
Someone has to you.
